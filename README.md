This is a VIM plugin which integrates [alchemist-server](https://github.com/tonini/alchemist-server) into VIM.

**alchemist-server** allows us to integrate this actions into VIM:

* Completion for Modules and functions.
* Documentation lookup for Modules and functions.
* Code evaluation and quoted representation of code.
* Definition lookup of code.
* Listing of all available Mix tasks.
* Listing of all available Modules with documentation.
* 

**NOTE** : This is an experimental project and needs extra features in *alchemist-server* which is on going disucssion in this [PR](https://github.com/tonini/alchemist-server/pull/8), as soon as the changes are ready I'll work on the plugin. Until then this repo exists so I can play around with Vimscript!
